        // Both substr and slice can't read the characters both side i.e. backward and forward they only read the characters in forward direction.

        // substring is same as slice but it has an additional ability of reading the characters in both direction i.e. forward and backward.
        // It has start index and as well as end index.
        // Lower number becomes the start index and the higher number becomes end index.
        // And prints exactly like slice from start index to end index - 1;
